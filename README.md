# 🛍️ AI-Powered Marketplace Assistant for Local Artisans  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Local artisans struggle to sell their products online because of:  
- ❌ Lack of digital literacy to create attractive listings.  
- ❌ Poor visibility in crowded marketplaces.  
- ❌ Difficulty writing compelling product descriptions.  
- ❌ Uncertainty in setting fair, competitive prices.  
- ❌ Limited customer engagement due to language and communication barriers.  

As a result, many artisans remain underpaid and under-recognized despite their unique skills.
